Intelligent Car Design and Manufacturing
Project Lead Engineer | University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (Mar 2023 - May 2023)

Developed core control algorithms for the car using C++ on the Keil Studio platform, including automatic direction correction, straight-line movement on rugged terrain, image recognition, and wireless communication.
Through multiple code iterations and optimizations, improved the image recognition success rate from 33% to 99%, and the overall success rate of testing tasks from 40% to 95%.
Integrated data from sensors such as a gyroscope (JY60), ultrasonic (HC-SR04), and vision processing (OpenMV) to enable real-time environmental perception and autonomous decision-making.
Designed a wireless communication system based on the HC-12 module, enabling real-time data transmission between the car and the PC.
